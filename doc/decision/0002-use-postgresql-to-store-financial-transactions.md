Date: 2021-10-17

## Status

Superceded by [3. Use XTDB to store financial transactions](0003-use-xtdb-to-store-financial-transactions.md)

A relational database is required to store financial transactions.

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL

## Consequences

PostgreSQL has wide industry adoption.

It is an acceptable tradeoff that horizontal scalability would not be easily achievable.
